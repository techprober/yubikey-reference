## GPG pull public key from keyserver

Notes: the following command will pull the target public key (including fingerprint) from keyserver

```bash
gpg --rec-keys <key id>
```

## GPG signing

### GPG sign a recipient's public key

Once you know a public key is used for encryption belongs to the person you think it does, you may sign it with the following command:

```
gpg --sign-key <recepient's email>
```

Before signing the key though, how do you know it can be trusted? If the intended recipient sent you the key directly, you can be sure, provided they are a trusted party. Else, you may ask the intended recipient to send you the fingerprint of the key. This can be retrieved by running the following command:

```
gpg --fingerprint <recepient's email>
```

## GPG export public key to keyserver

```bash
gpg --send-keys <key id>

# with a specific keyserver
gpg --key-server 'hkps://pgp.mit.edu' --send-keys <key id>
```

Refresh existing public keys

```bash
gpg --keyserver 'hkps://pgp.mit.edu' --refresh-keys
```

## GPG encrypt

Reference: https://www.misterpki.com/gpg-encrypt/

### GPG trust a recipient's public key

```
gpg --edit-key <recepient's public key>

# select the key with its index number
gpg> 1

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

### GPG encrypt text string with public key

```bash
echo "hello" | gpg --encrypt --recepient whoami@example.com --armor
```

### GPG encrypt files with public key

Encrypt a file to be sent to the intended recipient. Here is an example of encrypting a file named `message.txt`:

```bash
echo "hello" > message.txt
gpg --encrypt --recepient whoami@example.com --armor message.txt

# alternatively
gpg --encrypt -r whoami@example.com --armor message.txt
gpg --encrypt -r <key id> --armor message.txt
```

Note:

- `-r` is shorthand for `--recipient`. The encrypted file will be named `message.txt.gpg` and is ready to be sent via email or some alternative means of communication securely. The only person that can `decrypt` the file will be the holder of the private key of whoami@example.com.

- The recipient may be an `email` or a specific `key id`. GPG will recognize which is which, and the case of multiple keys, just specifying the `key id` instead of the email may be most convenient. Note that this is true for all options and not just the encrypt option.

### GPG encrypt text string with public key and signing

```bash
# alternatively
gpg --encrypt --sign -r whoami@example.com --armor message.txt
gpg --encrypt --sign -r <key id> --armor message.txt
```

## GPG Decryption

### GPG file decryption with private key

The GPG encrypted file can now ONLY be `decrypted` by the holder of the `private key`. To GPG decrypt the file with the private key, run the following command:

```bash
gpg --decrypt message.txt.gpg
```
